Welcome to the Dungeon World Discord Bot!
This bot is designed to streamline the mechanics of Dungeon World on a discord chat server.

It includes:
- a menu to look up all commands and functionality: ?menu or !menu
- a functional xdy +z dice roller which takes numerical or stat modifiers as z
- an in-chat character sheet which stores your character stats
- commands for all basic DW moves which automatically add relevant stats
- relevant move text is delivered based on success/failure of roll

To run this bot you will need to install node, redis, redis-jsonify, dotenv, and discord.js

The following tutorial provided quick instructions for setting up your bot, acquiring a token, creating a .env file, and getting your bot up and running. After that you can use this code.
